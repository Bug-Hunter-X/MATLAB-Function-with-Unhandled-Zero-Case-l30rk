# MATLAB Function with Unhandled Zero Case

This repository demonstrates a common MATLAB code error involving the improper handling of edge cases in conditional statements (if-elseif-else). The function `myFunction.m` contains a logical flaw where the case when the input `x` is exactly zero is not explicitly addressed. This oversight can lead to unexpected results or errors depending on the context.

The solution file `bugSolution.m` shows how to correct this error by explicitly handling the zero case within the conditional statement.
